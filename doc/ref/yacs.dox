 \section Introduction

 \b %YACS is a tool to supervise execution of complex interconnected 
 scientific applications on computer networks and clusters. 
 Interconnected scientific applications can be seen as a collection 
 of computational tasks that are executed in a known order.

 In %YACS such a kind of application is described by a calculation schema.
 %A calculation schema can be defined with an XML syntax and is mainly
 a graph of nodes that refer to computational tasks or control structures.
 Nodes are connected by control and data flow links.

 \section Features

 - Build calculation schemas from XML files
 - Execute calculation schema (batch, step by step)
 - Can manage mainly Salome component nodes, inline python nodes but
   also to a lesser extent : C++ component nodes, XML component nodes

 \section Packages

 %YACS is composed of several packages
 - \subpage bases : common base classes (threads,...) and constants
 - \subpage engine : calculation schema generic classes (calculation nodes, control nodes,
   control and data flow links, ...)
 - \subpage runtime : implementation of generic calculation nodes for Salome platform
 - \subpage xml_loader : XML reader for generic calculation schema
 - \subpage gui_design : Graphic User Interface design

 A Python API is provided by wrapping with swig : \subpage python

 \section Building

 For building %YACS, you need some prerequisites
 - g++ 4.1 or more (mandatory)
 - libxml2 (mandatory)
 - expat (mandatory)
 - omniorb 4.1 or more (mandatory)
 - python 2.3 and + (mandatory)
 - swig 1.3.31 (mandatory)
 - cppunits (optional, for unit tests only)
 - Salome 4.1.x (optional)

 If you want to install %YACS for SALOME, you need to set environment 
 variable: \b KERNEL_ROOT_DIR.

 If you want to install %YACS with SALOME GUI, you need to set environment 
 variable: \b GUI_ROOT_DIR.

 The building process is the traditional configure/make/make install:
 - configure --prefix=path_to_install
 - make

 Then you can run unit tests if cppunits is installed :
 - make check

 Then you can run a small demo in Demo directory:
 - cd Demo
 - make
 - launch the echoSrv server : ./echoSrv& (if the omniorb name server is not
   running you need to launch it : omniNames -start -logdir /tmp & should be enough)
 - run yacs supervisor with the schema.xml file : ../src/yacsloader/driver schema.xml

 Finally you can install yacs:
 - make install
 - read the doc in doc directory
 - go to src/yacsloader/samples directory for XML examples

  \section TODOs

 Many things but mainly:
 - add resource management features
 - add GUIs
