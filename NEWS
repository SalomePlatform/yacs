YACS GUI : list of missing functionalities and bugs
====================================================================================================

One list is initiated by EDF (problems detected by EDF), Another list can be completed by OCC 
(problems detected by OCC). The separaration will allow an easier CVS merge.
Each list contains numeroted items, with a description, comments from both parts,
a priority and a status.
The present file must be committed in CVS as often as required, in developments branchs.

description: On the launch of YACSGui, without any schema open, if we create a new schema, unless we 
double click on schema1 in object browser, we can add nothing because no schema is selected. It is 
not obvious and very frustrating. The must always be a schema selected.

description: add node from catalog is missing (from session and from existing schema file).
Must be implemented, it is the only way to add SALOME service nodes from SALOME components.
comments: OCC: This remarks concerns to both points 3 and 4. -a- As we
understand correctly, the only one possibility for nodes creation
should be available within YACS module. -b- It is a creation from two
types of catalog. -c- The type of catalog should be specified during
SALOME service node creation process in the additional dialog box. -d- It
is not possible to create an empty SALOME service node. -e- And it is not
possible to create a SALOME service node from component popup menu in
the tree view taking into account the selected component as a
component from which a service node will be created. Is the described
behaviour correct?
EDF: working examples for node clone from catalog are in guidemo.
(see editTree::ComposedNodeContextMenu in src/hmi/editTree.cxx)
-a- prefered mode of creation = pick a node from a catalog (see -e-)
-b,c,d- yes
-e- I am not sure to understand: select a service from a componentinstance already in tree ?
There could be here a shortcut but it is not a priority.
OCC: The creation of SALOME service nodes from session catalog is done.
EDF:
OK for Session Catalog
Using Catalog from existing schema file does not work.
Example scenario:
- Load SUPERV file salomeloader/samples/GeomGraph.xml and save it as a YACS schema.
  This schema is runnable.
- Create a new yacs schema, create a salome node, browse to find the saved schema. SIGSEGV

Try to select input c. Only one column is selected. Use the arrow up. It looks like only the selected
column is switched with input b, not the entire line. Clik on the other items of the two lines.
Sometimes the entire line is switched (OK) sometimes not... Confusing behaviour, not always the same.

nodes inside the bloc (nodes are outside). When there are two levels of blocks (see bloc1.xml),
same problem, and the bloc in the inner level is not movable. When we move the outer bloc
to englobe the inner bloc, the canvas flickers. The rezize of the bloc have a very strange behaviour.
comments:  OCC: Could you, please, provide a schema sample, on which
this bug is reproduced?
EDF: samples/bloc1.xml
EDF: Node placement from BR_OCC (january 7, 2008) works far better. I remove ordering in the BR_DEV
version (january 8, 2008) because it is possible to have link loops in YACS with loop nodes. See 
yacsloader/samples/legendre7.xml.

comments: OCC: Could you, please, provide a test scenario to reproduce
this bug?
EDF:
launch YACSGui
create new schema schema1
add a block
load samples/bloc1.xml (to activate node properties)
return to schema schema1
in bloc properties, Direct Children + (for add node)
a line number 1 appears in Direct Children with an empty node name
I don't know what to do after...
IMPORTANT NOTE: prefered way is to have a popup menu (add nodes) at bloc item in tree view (see 2).
Either the '+' button activate the same menu, or it must be grayed or removed.
OCC: DONE (see2)
EDF: button '+' in bloc properties, Direct Children is still active, it is still possible to try
to remove nodes from other buttons, with effect only on the property pannel. ==> this must be at least
grayed or removed if inactive)
EDF: I have finally understood the use of '+' button and selection, to move (reparent) a node,
idem with '-' button. It is not obvious to find how it works, but it works!
The main problem is if we forget to apply, there is no warning.
I don't know if it is possible to have tooltips on such buttons (or other kind of help)
comments: OCC: DONE, tooltips were added
EDF: still problems (unnecessary warning, abort) with warnings on apply on certain cases
scenario: Create several nodes and a block, move a node to the bloc and click on this node without apply.
abort on OK.

these buttons must be either removed, or grayed if they corresponds to something in development.
comments: OCC: DONE
EDF: Still a list of confusing buttons or menus without effect or with an unknown behaviour...
OCC: Could you, please, provide a list of such buttons and menus?
EDF(PR): OK I will try to make some snapshots and mark the things I don't understand.
EDF: Well, you already have done a lot of cleaning in the last versions. There are still a few 
things remaining.
1 buttons data flow view and data stream view do nothing (comment in source until implementation)
2 idem in schema property panel
3 menu create node/node node service does nothing (grayed or comment in source until implementation)
4 menu create node/from library does nothing (to be removed)
5 menu create node, from a component instance item in tree (does nothing, could be useful, to check)
6 search in python script, property panel does not work with qscintilla. Not very useful, could be 
  removed.
7 in execution mode, button "remote run, control" could be removed, provided execution mode radio buttons
  and "stop on error" check button exist somewhere (the existing button "stop on error" is not clear:
  is it a toggle ?). It should be possible to start an execution in a mode and switch to another mode
  at any time during the execution (step by step / breakpoints / without stop).
EDF: 1,2,3,4,6: OK --- 5,7: NOK
comments: OCC: 
5 DONE: 1) It is possible now to create a Salome service node
from a Salome component instance item selected in the edition tree
view. In such a case, we take the first method name from the catalog"s
service map as a default service for the created node. This method may
be changed later with help of the property page of service node. 2) It
is possible to create a Corba service node from a Corba component
instance selected in the edition tree view. But in such a case I have a
question: How can I retrieve a list of services from Corba component
instance? Is it possible?
EDF: CORBA nodes are not a priority. SALOME node are created with the first method,
but it is now impossible to change the method (that was too complicated and dangerous).
It still could be use as it is for components with one method.
7 DONE: The modes of schema execution ( without stop / breakpoints /
step by step ) were moved to the exclusive group of toggle buttons on
the execution toolbar. "Stop on error" toggle button is placed on the
execution toolbar too. The "remote run, control" button was removed.
EDF: execution mode left only in menu, not in toolbar (confusing: not an action)

description: When editing a node (for instance a python script), if we switch on another node without 
apply, everything is lost...
(in guidemo, I used a qt stack of widget for properties, so each item have it's own instance. No specific
action necessary to keep values of each widget). Either something similar is reproduced, or a state
of modification is generated to ask for apply/cancel before switch (may be difficult to implement
properly...)
comments: OCC: OK, we will try to implement the second way: warn the user if he selects another object
without applying modifications (if modifications were really done) for the current object.
In such a case we will provide two possibilities: Apply - to apply modifications for the current object
and switch selection to the choosen object, Cancel - to lose modifications for the current object and
switch selection to the choosen object. Is it suitable for you?
EDF: yes

description: Confusing behaviour, when switching from execution to edition and reverse.
Example: create a new schema with 2 python script nodes, one producing to outputs double(a,b), the other
with 2 input double (a,b) and an output double (c) (script: c=a+b), create the 2 links a->a b->b and execute.
return to edition and create a third script node (r=p*q) and connect its inputs to outputs from the
previous nodes.
If you create a new execution (click on object browser, Schema1) you got the 3 nodes without the new links.
you have first to make apply on schema properties in edition : A state of modification is needed to ask
for apply changes before execution.

status--: OK (checked on BR_DEV mergefrom_BR_PR_29jan08)
description: When switching from execution to edition and reverse, each execution may correspond to a modified
schema. Now, all executions are under the same item in object browser. There is no way to retrieve a
particular version of the schema corresponding to an execution.
The best thing to do is to create a new schema entry in object browser at the first modification of
an already executed schema, or, better, to force an explicit (visible) copy of an executed schema to allow
modifications.
comments: OCC: As we understand correctly, you want to have a possibility to open the schema corresponding
to any run object in the edition state (i.e. to create a new schema object in the object browser,
edition tree view and 2D view for it) to continue its modification and after that to create a new run object
based on the modified schema and execute it taking into account the last modifications. Is it right?
If yes, we think, that it may be done with help of e.g. "New edition" popup menu item on the run object
in the object browser (and/or the same toolbar button, as it was done for creation of a new execution).
EDF(PR): Yes, I think it is OK. To be complete, when a schema is executed, it must be impossible to modify
it without copy,to keep the coherence between the schema and it's execution.
comments: OCC: DONE
EDF: The schema is still modifiable after execution, but it is always possible to retreive the original
with "new edition" popup menu on execuction item (OK)

from catalogs. For instance, use GEOM_Object in a python node.
comments:
 - 1 - the list of availables data types in ports must be updated
with all data types already available in the data types list of the
current schema, 
OCC: DONE: At the current moment there are two ways to choose a port data
type:
1a) if the data type is a simple type the user can set it, even it is not
publicated in the edition tree view with help of combo box
available for the "Type" column in the edition mode;
1b) the complex data types may be choosen with help of the selection
control available for the "Type" column in the edition mode; in such a
case the user can pick directly a data type in the edition tree view.
 - 2 - by default the list contains only simple types : bool, int,
double, string (other types are not usable in a generic form, they
must be specialised) OCC: DONE.
 - 3 - the data type list of the schema is automatically updated
when importing nodes from catalogs. OCC: it is already done, because
of the edition tree view updates on importing nodes from catalog in
order to show all available data types inside the current schema.
 - 4 - it should be possible also to specifically import a
particular data type from a catalog, by means of a popup on Data Types
Container in edition tree view. OCC: DONE.
 - 5 - note that import node from catalog is not restricted to
SALOME service nodes. all kind of nodes can be imported from catalogs,
even python script nodes, taken from catalogs built apon other
schemas.

 With this approach list of data types does not grow too fast and
the combo box could still be used (warning, complex data types have
long names...).
 Another possibility is to allow to pick directly a data type in a
catalog in the port definition, but it is not possible with the combo
box...
EDF: 5 DONE, with a problem of canvas representation when import composed nodes, that can only
be solved now by export and reimport the schema. The tree view for catalog from proc must reflect
the proc schema hierarchy (otherwise there could be confusion with nodes of the same name)

the edition tree view.
