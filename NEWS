YACS GUI : list of missing functionalities and bugs
====================================================================================================

One list is initiated by EDF (problems detected by EDF), Another list can be completed by OCC 
(problems detected by OCC). The separaration will allow an easier CVS merge.
Each list contains numeroted items, with a description, comments from both parts,
a priority and a status.
The present file must be committed in CVS as often as required, in developments branchs.



Problems detected by EDF

Num ----: 1
priority: 0
status--: OK (checked on BR_DEV mergefrom_BR_PR_8jan08)
description: On the launch of YACSGui, without any schema open, if we create a new schema, unless we 
double click on schema1 in object browser, we can add nothing because no schema is selected. It is 
not obvious and very frustrating. The must always be a schema selected.
comments: OCC: DONE. This functionality will be available from CVS today evening.

inside a block or other composed node.

status--: OK (checked on BR_DEV mergefrom_BR_PR_10jan08)
description: add node from catalog is missing (from session and from existing schema file).
Must be implemented, it is the only way to add SALOME service nodes from SALOME components.
comments: OCC: This remarks concerns to both points 3 and 4. -a- As we
understand correctly, the only one possibility for nodes creation
should be available within YACS module. -b- It is a creation from two
types of catalog. -c- The type of catalog should be specified during
SALOME service node creation process in the additional dialog box. -d- It
is not possible to create an empty SALOME service node. -e- And it is not
possible to create a SALOME service node from component popup menu in
the tree view taking into account the selected component as a
component from which a service node will be created. Is the described
behaviour correct?
EDF: working examples for node clone from catalog are in guidemo.
(see editTree::ComposedNodeContextMenu in src/hmi/editTree.cxx)
-a- prefered mode of creation = pick a node from a catalog (see -e-)
-b,c,d- yes
-e- I am not sure to understand: select a service from a componentinstance already in tree ?
There could be here a shortcut but it is not a priority.
OCC: The creation of SALOME service nodes from session catalog is done.
EDF:
OK for Session Catalog
Using Catalog from existing schema file does not work.
Example scenario:
- Load SUPERV file salomeloader/samples/GeomGraph.xml and save it as a YACS schema.
  This schema is runnable.
- Create a new yacs schema, create a salome node, browse to find the saved schema. SIGSEGV

description: in python node properties, the port creation works, but the other buttons (arrows...)
have a confusing behaviour, and lead sometimes to sigsegv.

comments: OCC: DONE. Debugged.
EDF: No more SIGSEGV observed but the behaviour is strange.
Example:
Create a python script or function node, add 3 input dataflow ports a, b, c type int, double, string
Try to select input c. Only one column is selected. Use the arrow up. It looks like only the selected
column is switched with input b, not the entire line. Clik on the other items of the two lines.
Sometimes the entire line is switched (OK) sometimes not... Confusing behaviour, not always the same.

description: Node placement looks OK when there are no blocs, but there are problems of placement of
nodes inside the bloc (nodes are outside). When there are two levels of blocks (see bloc1.xml),
same problem, and the bloc in the inner level is not movable. When we move the outer bloc
to englobe the inner bloc, the canvas flickers. The rezize of the bloc have a very strange behaviour.
comments:  OCC: Could you, please, provide a schema sample, on which
this bug is reproduced?
EDF: samples/bloc1.xml
EDF: Node placement from BR_OCC (january 7, 2008) works far better. I remove ordering in the BR_DEV
version (january 8, 2008) because it is possible to have link loops in YACS with loop nodes. See 
yacsloader/samples/legendre7.xml.

this bug?
EDF:

add a block
load samples/bloc1.xml (to activate node properties)
return to schema schema1
in bloc properties, Direct Children + (for add node)
a line number 1 appears in Direct Children with an empty node name
I don't know what to do after...
IMPORTANT NOTE: prefered way is to have a popup menu (add nodes) at bloc item in tree view (see 2).
Either the '+' button activate the same menu, or it must be grayed or removed.
OCC: DONE (see2)
EDF: button '+' in bloc properties, Direct Children is still active, it is still possible to try
to remove nodes from other buttons, with effect only on the property pannel. ==> this must be at least
grayed or removed if inactive)
EDF: I have finally understood the use of '+' button and selection, to move (reparent) a node,
idem with '-' button. It is not obvious to find how it works, but it works!
The main problem is if we forget to apply, there is no warning.
I don't know if it is possible to have tooltips on such buttons (or other kind of help)

description: When editing a node (for instance a python script), if we switch on another node without 
apply, everything is lost...
(in guidemo, I used a qt stack of widget for properties, so each item have it's own instance. No specific
action necessary to keep values of each widget). Either something similar is reproduced, or a state
of modification is generated to ask for apply/cancel before switch (may be difficult to implement
properly...)
comments: OCC: OK, we will try to implement the second way: warn the user if he selects another object
without applying modifications (if modifications were really done) for the current object.
In such a case we will provide two possibilities: Apply - to apply modifications for the current object
and switch selection to the choosen object, Cancel - to lose modifications for the current object and
switch selection to the choosen object. Is it suitable for you?
EDF: yes

description: Confusing behaviour, when switching from execution to edition and reverse.
Example: create a new schema with 2 python script nodes, one producing to outputs double(a,b), the other
with 2 input double (a,b) and an output double (c) (script: c=a+b), create the 2 links a->a b->b and execute.
return to edition and create a third script node (r=p*q) and connect its inputs to outputs from the
previous nodes.
If you create a new execution (click on object browser, Schema1) you got the 3 nodes without the new links.
you have first to make apply on schema properties in edition : A state of modification is needed to ask
for apply changes before execution.

description: When switching from execution to edition and reverse, each execution may correspond to a modified
schema. Now, all executions are under the same item in object browser. There is no way to retrieve a
particular version of the schema corresponding to an execution.
The best thing to do is to create a new schema entry in object browser at the first modification of
an already executed schema, or, better, to force an explicit (visible) copy of an executed schema to allow
modifications.
comments: OCC: As we understand correctly, you want to have a possibility to open the schema corresponding
to any run object in the edition state (i.e. to create a new schema object in the object browser,
edition tree view and 2D view for it) to continue its modification and after that to create a new run object
based on the modified schema and execute it taking into account the last modifications. Is it right?
If yes, we think, that it may be done with help of e.g. "New edition" popup menu item on the run object
in the object browser (and/or the same toolbar button, as it was done for creation of a new execution).
EDF(PR): Yes, I think it is OK. To be complete, when a schema is executed, it must be impossible to modify
it without copy,to keep the coherence between the schema and it's execution.

description: when modifying 2 output ports, type double to int, in a pyscript node, only one modif

comments: OCC: Could you, please, provide a test scenario to reproduce this bug?
EDF: For instance, create a new schema, a pyscript node, add 2 inputs ports a and b type double and apply.
Then, change both type to int then apply, WITHOUT cliking elsewhere between the last combo box for type and
the apply button.

description: in create node menu, node node service is confusing. It is better to create a 
service node, then to associate it with another node with which the component instance is shared.
comments: OCC: DONE. There are two ways now to set component to the
SALOME service node: with help of selection control from Input Panel
for the SALOME service node the user can set the component to the
selected service node 1) by selection a SALOME component in the
edition tree view, 2) by selection an another SALOME service node in
the edition tree view.
EDF: not clear without component instance names, it seems it does not work:
create a new schema with to salome service nodes from AddComponent. One instance of AddComponent is
created by default on DefaultContainer, for each node. OK.
It is not possible to change the component instance of node 2 to the other component instance
(selection control does nothing).
